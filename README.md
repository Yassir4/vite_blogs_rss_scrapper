## Description
This is a project using Vite and Javascript where I built a custom articles rss feed to keep up to date with some of my favorite writers.


## Setup
First check the setup of backend written in ruby on rails [here](https://github.com/Yassir4/rails_blog_scrapper).

After that create a .env file and add the localhost url that rails is running in like this.

```
    VITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Finally

```
npm install && npm run dev
```
